# Fido2Net

This is a set of .NET classes and bindings for wrapping the [libfido2](https://github.com/Yubico/libfido2) implementation.  You must first build the native dependencies via the provided script:  build_deps.ps1 / build_deps_macos.sh / build_deps_ubuntu.sh.  Other variants of Linux should examine the "apt-get" section of the script to determine what dependencies to install (libssl / libudev).

## Main API

### `FidoAssertion`

This class is responsible for handling the **assertion** portion of the FIDO2 logic.  That is to say, a credential has already been created and a remote party would like to validate that the user is in control of said credential.  

### `FidoCredential`

This class is what gets created during the **attestation** portion of the FIDO2 logic, and what is used during the **assertion** portion.

### `FidoDevice`

This class abstracts a FIDO2 capable device and lets you interact with it.  It is responsible for credential and assertion creation (see its usage in the `FidoAssertion` and `FidoCredential` examples)

### `FidoDeviceInfoList`

This class will enumerate attached FIDO2 devices for you
